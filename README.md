# ESP32-Based Weather Station

This project is an ESP32-based weather station that measures and logs temperature, humidity, pressure, and rainfall data. The collected data is sent to Google Sheets using Google Apps Script.

## Features

- ðŸ“¡ **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Connects to Wi-Fi and logs data online.
- ðŸŒ¡ **Temperature Sensor**: Measures ambient temperature.
- ðŸ’§ **Humidity Sensor**: Captures humidity levels.
- ðŸŒ¦ **Rain Gauge**: Uses a tipping bucket mechanism to measure rainfall.
- ðŸŒª **Pressure Sensor**: Reads atmospheric pressure.
- ðŸ”‹ **Solar-Powered**: Uses a CN3065 mini solar charger with a 18650 battery and CE8301 boost converter.
- ðŸ“Š **Data Logging**: Stores data in Google Sheets.
- ðŸ–¨ **3D-Printed Enclosures**: Custom enclosures for the solar power system and sensor housing.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32
- DHT22 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)
- BMP280 (Pressure Sensor)
- Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge
- I2C LCD Display (Optional)
- CN3065 Mini Solar Charger
- 18650 Battery
- CE8301 Boost Converter
- 3D-Printed Enclosures

## Software Requirements

- PlatformIO in Visual Studio Code
- Libraries:
  - `WiFiManager` by tzapu
  - `LiquidCrystal_I2C`
  - `DHT Sensor library` by Adafruit
  - `Adafruit BMP280 Library` by Adafruit
  - `HTTPClient.h`
- Google Apps Script (for Google Sheets integration)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Required Libraries

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed in PlatformIO. Use the `platformio.ini` file to include dependencies.

### 2. Configure and Upload ESP32 Code

1. Upload the firmware to the ESP32 using PlatformIO.
2. Monitor the Serial Monitor for connection and data transmission logs.

### 3. First-Time Wi-Fi Configuration

If the device does not detect any saved Wi-Fi credentials, it will create an access point with the following details:

- **SSID:** `ESPW`
- **Password:** `00000007`

On the LCD display, it will show:

```
ESPW: 00000007
```

Connect to this access point using a phone or computer, and follow the on-screen instructions to configure your Wi-Fi connection.

### 4. 3D-Printed Enclosures

The project includes 3D-printed enclosures for the solar power system and sensor housing. The STL files are available in the repository:
- **Solar Power Enclosure**
- **Sensor Housing**
- **Connector for Enclosures**

Preview and download the STL files from [this repository link].

## Usage

- The ESP32 collects data at regular intervals (e.g., every minute) and sends it to Google Sheets.
- Data is saved in daily sheets (e.g., `Feb-02`, `Feb-03`, etc.).

## Troubleshooting

- **Wi-Fi Not Connecting?** Ensure correct credentials and check network strength.
- **Data Not Logging?** Check Apps Script logs and ESP32 serial monitor.
- **Battery Draining Quickly?** Check solar charging status and optimize power usage.

## Future Enhancements

- ðŸ“¡ MQTT for real-time data streaming
- ðŸŒŽ Web dashboard for better visualization
- ðŸ”„ Deep sleep mode for power efficiency
- ðŸ“ˆ AppSheet integration for data visualization
